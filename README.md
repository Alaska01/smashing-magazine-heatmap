## Smashing Magazine
This is a Smashing Magazine Heat Map clone.

PROJECT:  DESIGN TEARDOWN
<br>
In this project, our main aim was to learn how to align elements with float, flex and grid in CSS. Our goal for this project was to think in terms of visual hierarchy, typography and design principles to implement it in our design. We made it to a grayscale heat map website that indicates which elements have the greatest weight in the visual hierarchy.

## Getting started
**We cloned a Smashing Magazine Heat Map. The main aim was to enforce visual hierarchy, typography and design principles.The elements get placed and styled roughly the same way as the source, so functionality is not a priority.**

We used the browser‚Äôs developer tools to inspect the real Smashing Magazine Heat Map web page to understand how elements are placed and styled.
We built our own page in a .html text file and opened it in our browser to check it out. We carried out the following steps:
  - First setup a github repository for the project.
  - Then create a .html file where all our HTML markup will go
  - Create a .css file where all our styling code will reside
